# Linux systemd Service

The systemd unit [lcd-off.service](lcd-off.service) can be installed to automatically switch off the embedded LCD on boot.

The unit file has been tailored to Debian based Linux distros and has been tested on Proxmox 8.4 and Ubuntu 25.04.

Requirements:
- `/dev/ttyACM0`: `dialout` group with rw permissions. 
  - To run as root: remove `DynamicUser` and `Group` settings. 


## Install

As root user, otherwise `sudo` is required:
```shell
cp asterctl /usr/bin/
cp lcd-off.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable lcd-off
```

## Security

The systemd unit file uses strong security settings to only allow operations required for `asterctl`:

```shell
systemd-analyze security lcd-off.service
```
